Debugging is the process of finding and solving errors in code.
A bug is errror in code that prevents it from functioning the way it was intended
A bug is a glitch that prevents a software from achieving desired output


Types of bugs
-syntax errors;
These occur when the code doesnot follow the syntactical rules. eg "<div classhome></div?
-Logic errors;
These occur when the steps take  to perform the task correctly are not well done eg an infinite loop.
-Design bug
this is a bug that is carried from the designers to the actua; implemention of the code
this is a bug caused by poor and/or inadequate design decisions eg poor user interface(ui), wrong datatypes
-Runtime errors
these errors cannot be noticed until the code has actually been run eg dividing with a null  value, dividing a number by zero, adding a string to an integer




Why  debug?
-To remove errors from code
-To save resources ie time and money
-Enables to improve productivity and efficiency

Debugging principles
=> Bugs caught early are the easiest to fix 
=> Once bugs escape they become  very hard to 
find ie since you most likely dont have the details
in your minds and the code base has grown


THE DEBUGGING CYCLE
1. Coding (writing the code)
2. Testing (checking the code functionality/output)
3. If the code is not working , go on to debug
5.Then repeat cycle  as they all go

A BUG SEEKING CYCLE
difference between debugging and testing;
Debugging is what can i do to fixe erronous code while testing 
is what i need to do to break my code eg 


STEPS OF DEBUGGING
1.Plan your attack
2.Backup your files(interchangeable)using version control/ github to keep track of changes in my software
3.Isolate the block of code that could have the error ie  commenting it out 
4. Find the actual line(s)with the error or bugging
5.Fix the error dont patch it 
6. Test the fix you have just done
7.look for similar bugs
